# Kickstarter-analysis
 Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
The purpose of the analysis is to get a proper overview of different outcomes (Successful, failed and canceled) based on different factors (i.e. different launch dates and goals).
Challenges faced with Deliverable 1 Analysis
   When performing my analysis on Deliverable 1, I had an issue with my pivot chart i.e. what should be on the different fields in the chart. In order, to overcome this challenge, i had to go back to lesson 1.3.2. (Charting the parent category) to try and understand the pivot charting a little bit more. After reading through it one more time, it made my work on the analysis easier.
 Challenges faced with Deliverable 2 Analysis
    When performing the analysis on Deliverable 2, I had a major issue with the COUNTIFS() function for the different goals. I watched the video (Microsoft Excel  COUNTIFS() Function) on the Module 1 Challenge page, and tried to understand the use of this function in order to overcome this challenge.

# Kickstarter-analysis
 Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
The purpose of the analysis is to get a proper overview of different outcomes (Successful, failed and canceled) based on different factors (i.e. different launch dates and goals).
Challenges faced with Deliverable 1 Analysis
   When performing my analysis on Deliverable 1, I had an issue with my pivot chart i.e. what should be on the different fields in the chart. In order, to overcome this challenge, i had to go back to lesson 1.3.2. (Charting the parent category) to try and understand the pivot charting a little bit more. After reading through it one more time, it made my work on the analysis easier.
 Challenges faced with Deliverable 2 Analysis
    When performing the analysis on Deliverable 2, I had a major issue with the COUNTIFS() function for the different goals. I watched the video (Microsoft Excel  COUNTIFS() Function) on the Module 1 Challenge page, and tried to understand the use of this function in order to overcome this challenge. After doing this, it made my work on the analysis much easier.

Two Conclusions drawn from the Outcomes based on Goals.
   One conclusion is that 
Limitations from the Dataset.
    One limitation from the first analysis is that it is focused on only theater not all other subcategories.
    A limitation from the second analysis is that it is focused on only plays.
    Another limitation from the second analysis is that it focused on only the successful, failed or canceled outcomes.
Other possible tables/graphs we could create.
    We can create tables/graphs based on different categories in analysis 1.
    We can also create tables/graphs based on different subcategoies in analysis 2.
